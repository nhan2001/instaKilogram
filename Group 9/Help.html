	  <h1>How can we help you?</h1>
	  
	  <h2 id = "C1"> Sign Up </h2>
	  <p class = "content"> This is where you want to register for an account if you don't have any. In here you have to input your data into the fields of the form. <br>
		However as our Privacy policy implies, we only store essential information of the user and not allowed to process your sensitive data. <br>
		You are not limited to input your real information as we don't really need to validate the transparent of the data, in fact you are allowed to have any APPROPRIATE value <br>
		that you want.
		</p>
		<aside>  Note that the reason why we use email address is that not only it provide uniqueness to all users but also give users a chance to recover their password. Furthermore allows us to contact to you in any time.</aside>
		<h2 id = "C2"> Login </h2>
		<p class = "content"> If you have already had an account, you may want to process to the webpage where you can use InstaKilogram. In that case, you have to use your registered email and password for 
		the login form, note that you can use saved password in your browser for the convenient. The login form always appears on our main page, however if you have login already, you don't have to fill in the 
		form if you accepted the <a href = "Policy.html"> Cookie Consent </a>. Otherwise you will be push back to the login form if you deliberately access to your profile without accepting the Consent yet.
			</p>
			<h2 id = "C3"> Upload a post </h2>
		<p class = "content"> We always want to make our InstaKilogram application environmental friendly. Here we support the posting feature for users to express their status, emotion. <br>
		This is one of the features that we are proud of. If you want to achieve the best experience, you should know how to upload a post which many users fail to do so. <br>
		There are three parameters that need to be completed, the descrition is to let the user write a story, status with any length. The Choose File button allows you to <br>
		upload and embed that file into your post, so whenever a post is created, a file and a description will be displayed. However  Only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed. <br>
		Finally, you can also choose three different level options that denote visibility:
		<ul>
		<li> Public: anyone (including guests) can view</li>
		<li> Internal: only logged-in users can view</li>
		<li> Private: only the user who shares can view </li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id = "C4"> What is guest page ? </h2>
		<p class = "content"> If you are not logged in, guest page is where anonymous users can view public posts without having to sign in. The reason for that is we want to introduce how environmental friendly and user friendly 
		the site can get. You can rarely see any sort of inappropriate posts with inappropriate picture or inappropriate description. We also make sure that guests can experience some important features of Instakilogram while limiting 
		some functionalities that only logged in users can have.
			</p>
		<h2 id = "C5"> Why I can't sign up for my account ? </h2>
		<p class = "content"> The failure of signing up most likely link with inputted value of the user. As we say users can input any data but in fact there are some restrictions. In order to successfully sign up you must follow these rules:
		
			</p>
			<ul>
		<li> Email address must be unique for all users. If there is a warning tells that an email address has been used then you need to either login or use another email address</li>
		<li> Profile picture must have one of these formats jpg/jpeg, png, and gif</li>
		<li> The email address must be in the Gmail format: Ex abcde@gmail.com </li>
